            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lessons</h1><p>One-on-one lessons are a great way to start diving in and taking on music in depth. However, I believe the best way to learn and practice what you learn in a lesson is to play with other musicians. This is where most lessons stop short and where most musicians get hung up. Nothing can replace the learn-by-doing approach of playing with other music, and the sheer joy that is communicating with another human being with music. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3026e7efa0950fa3d2d77b50472429ae3399118c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
