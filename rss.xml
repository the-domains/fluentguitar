            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lessons</h1><p>One-on-one lessons are a great way to start diving in and taking on music in depth. However, I believe the best way to learn and practice what you learn in a lesson is to play with other musicians. This is where most lessons stop short and where most musicians get hung up. Nothing can replace the learn-by-doing approach of playing with other music, and the sheer joy that is communicating with another human being with music. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b73670a2-fdbe-4025-8491-5ce1098077a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
